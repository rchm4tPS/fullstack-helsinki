# Exercise 0.4 Guide

<p>
Create a similar diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note on the page https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes by writing something into the text field and clicking the Save button.

<p>
If necessary, show operations on the browser or on the server as comments on the diagram.
</p>

The diagram does not have to be a sequence diagram. Any sensible way of presenting the events is fine.
